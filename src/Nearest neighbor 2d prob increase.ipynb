    "### Testing \"local\" vs. \"global\" effect\n",
    "It is possible that the nearest neighbor being connected merely indicates that the presynaptic neuron has a high out-degree, which then increases the connection probabilities with _all_ other neurons. We call this the \"global\" morphology effect.\n",
    "Alternatively, there can be a spatially limited effect, where the connection probability is increased in a specific area around the nearest neighbor. We call this a \"local\" morphology effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total effect can be a mixture of both, and in this notebook we conduct further analyses to further separate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end we conduct an analysis of connection probabilities not just against distance, but against horizontal and vertical offsets from the pre-/post-synaptic neuron. \n",
    "The global effect will have no specific spatial structure, i.e., the increase in connection probability if the nearest neighbor is connected should be the same at each offset.\n",
    "Additionally, we analyze also the connectivity of a **configuration model** fitted against the data. That is a model that shuffles the locations of connections, but preserves the in- and out-degrees of all neurons. As the global effect is simply based on some neurons having a higher degree than others, the configuration model will capture it completely."

    "## Setup\n",
    "We begin by importing relevant packages and setting up paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization options\n",
    "We have set up this notebook and the paths below for the analysis of the excitatory subgraph of the MICrONS connectome, version 1412.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can use it to analyze other connectomes as well, as long as they are formatted in the .hdf5-based format of Connectome-Utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such example is full_microns_PA.h5, which is created by the notebook \"Fit other models to microns\" and contains a preferential-attachment model fit to the microns data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching the results\n",
    "This analysis is somewhat computationally expensive (~20 minutes for 50k neuron connectomes). Hence, we broke it up into two parts: First, we calculate a pandas.DataFrame that holds pre-digested data. Then we plot the data according to customizable specifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the first, expensive step is saved into a file, such that it does not have to be re-calculated: In future executions it is instead read from the file, unless you set the \"force_recalculation\" flag to True. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: (Update, Dec. 2025): We have updated the notebook to allow filtering for \"trustworthy\" neurons in the connectome. That is, only some neurons are considered trustworthy for the outgoing connectivity, and a different set is considered trustworthy for the incoming connectivity. Pairs of neurons are only considered for calculation of connection probabilities if the potential presynaptic partner is trustworthy for outgoing connectivity and the postsynaptic partner is trustworthy for incoming connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is that the results are more noisy and lower p-values are reached, as fewer samples are analyzed. On the other hand, analyses are also much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the MICrONS data, we suggest limiting outgoing connectivity to neurons with proofread axons and not limiting incoming connectivity not at all, as dendrites require less proofreading than axons. We provide instructions below for setting this up."
