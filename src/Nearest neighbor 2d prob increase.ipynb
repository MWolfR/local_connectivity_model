    "### Testing \"local\" vs. \"global\" effect\n",
    "It is possible that the nearest neighbor being connected merely indicates that the presynaptic neuron has a high out-degree, which then increases the connection probabilities with _all_ other neurons. We call this the \"global\" morphology effect.\n",
    "Alternatively, there can be a spatially limited effect, where the connection probability is increased in a specific area around the nearest neighbor. We call this a \"local\" morphology effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total effect can be a mixture of both, and in this notebook we conduct further analyses to further separate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end we conduct an analysis of connection probabilities not just against distance, but against horizontal and vertical offsets from the pre-/post-synaptic neuron. \n",
    "The global effect will have no specific spatial structure, i.e., the increase in connection probability if the nearest neighbor is connected should be the same at each offset.\n",
    "Additionally, we analyze also the connectivity of a **configuration model** fitted against the data. That is a model that shuffles the locations of connections, but preserves the in- and out-degrees of all neurons. As the global effect is simply based on some neurons having a higher degree than others, the configuration model will capture it completely."
